# If you want to use options below, please uncomment that option and give appropriate argument.
#
# Type which URL should be used with urpmi.addmedia --distrib
#
#user_distrib_url=""

# Medias which will not be ignored (useful for Nonfree and Tainted builds):
#
#user_no_ignore_media="Nonfree Release Nonfree Updates"

# Type which directory should compiled rpms be uploaded:
# You can use Mageia version and architecture for directories of
# both i586 and x86_64 archs. Be sure that you use $arch variable
# 
# E.g. somedir/$mga_version/$arch ( Translated as somedir/cauldron/i586 in the script, depending of your choice)
#
#user_upload_directory=""

# To save bandwith and time, you can specify a directory of previously downloaded rpms
# This directory will be used as urpmi cache.
# You can use Mageia version and architecture for directories of
# both i586 and x86_64 archs. Be sure that you use $arch variable
# 
# E.g. some_cache_dir/$mga_version/$arch ( Translated as somedir/cauldron/i586 in the script, depending of your choice)
#
#use_rpm_cache="1" # Yes, i want to use rpm cache
#user_cache_directory=""

# Type here path of your chroot-tarballs (for creating or using)
#
#user_tarball_directory=""

# Do you want to delete old rpms in your rpm cache directory? Type 1 for Yes; 0 for No.
#
#user_tidy_rpm_cache="1" #yes

# Do you want to delete old rpms in your rpm upload directory? Type 1 for Yes; 0 for No.
#
#user_tidy_uploaded_rpms="1" #yes

# You can tell zeynep that you only want to compile packages for specified architectures below.
# Valid options are: x86_64, i586 or both
# The option "both" will compile package for both 64bit and 32bit architectures
# Note that you *must* have a x86_64 system to use this "both" option.
#
#user_arch="  "

# Do you want to sign your compiled rpms? Type here 1 for YES or 0 for NO:
#
#use_rpm_sign="1"

#Do you want zeynep to automatically add your rpmmacros file from your Home directory
#into chroot environment? If you do, then uncomment below line
#
#use_rpm_macros="1"

# Do you want to generate hdlists in your rpm upload directory? Useful 
# for adding this directory as urpmi media. Type here 1 for YES or 0 for NO:
# 
#user_generate_hdlists="1"

# Do you want to use your SRPM directory as rpm upload directory?
# Notice that this option causes that rpms uploaded in ../RPMS/$arch
# Type here 1 for YES or 0 for NO:
#
#user_local_build="1"

# After a failed or succesful build; zeynep removes chroot directory
# which is in /tmp directory by default. If you want zeynep to don't  remove
# chroot directory then type here 1 for YES or 0 for NO.
# This option is useful for investigating problems in RPM_BUILD_ROOT
# which is in /tmp/zeynep-builder-XX/chroot/home/$USER/rpmbuild directory
#
# user_no_clean_build_dir="1"


# Additional functions to use in zeynep:
#
# Uncomment below "prebuild_stuff" variable to source your functions
# which should be used *JUST BEFORE* package building. This does not
# interfere with setting up chroot environment and other stuff.
# It runs user defined functions just before executing *zeynep-builder*
# 
# You can define functions as many as you wish. But you should include all
# of them in a main "prebuild_functions" function. Zeynep only reads and
# sources that.
#
#prebuild_stuff="1"
#prebuild_functions () {

#}

#
# Uncomment below "postbuild_stuff" variable to source your functions
# which should be used *JUST AFTER* package building. This does not
# interfere with setting up chroot environment and other stuff.
# It runs user defined functions just after executing *zeynep-builder*
# 
# You can define functions as many as you wish. But you should include all
# of them in a main "postbuild_functions" function. Only exception to this
# is if a function runs a function before. Then you should not include it in
# our "postbuild_functions" function. Zeynep only reads and sources that.

#postbuild_stuff="1"

#postbuild_functions () {
