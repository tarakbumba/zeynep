# You can tell zeynep that you only want to compile packages for specified architectures below.
# Valid options are: x86_64, i586 or both
# The option "both" will compile package for both 64bit and 32bit architectures
# Note that you *must* have a x86_64 system to use this "both" option.
#
#user_arch="  "

# Do you want to sign your compiled rpms? Type here 1 for YES or 0 for NO:
#
#use_rpm_sign="1"

# which is in /tmp/zeynep-builder-XX/chroot/home/$USER/rpmbuild directory

# Additional functions to use in zeynep:
#
# Uncomment below "prebuild_stuff" variable to source your functions
# which should be used *JUST BEFORE* package building. This does not
# interfere with setting up chroot environment and other stuff.
# It runs user defined functions just before executing *zeynep-builder*
# 
# You can define functions as many as you wish. But you should include all
# of them in a main "prebuild_functions" function. Zeynep only reads and
# sources that.
#
#prebuild_stuff="1"
#prebuild_functions () {

#
# Uncomment below "postbuild_stuff" variable to source your functions
# which should be used *JUST AFTER* package building. This does not
# interfere with setting up chroot environment and other stuff.
# It runs user defined functions just after executing *zeynep-builder*
# 
# You can define functions as many as you wish. But you should include all
# of them in a main "postbuild_functions" function. Only exception to this
# is if a function runs a function before. Then you should not include it in
# our "postbuild_functions" function. Zeynep only reads and sources that.
